make Close delete VMs and Clusters that didn't exist when we started, so the directory truly reverts
adjust contexts in examples so that ^C doesn't always nuke the VMs, otherwise save doesn't work.
snapshot stuff to make freezing more useful
adjust RTC settings for vms
sequence shutdowns better so that we separate "I asked things to terminate" from "everything is done and cleaned up"
MetalLB tests!


New API:
 - vkube Open() and Create(), similar to os.File. Either create an
   empty universe, or open an existing one.
   - Does Opening an existing universe immediately resume everything
     inside it? I think so?
 - universe.Close() stops everything, reverts everything to savepoint.
 - universe.Save() stops everything, but snapshots everything so the
   next Open() will resume from this moment.
 - universe.Destroy() stops everything, deletes everything. Nuke the
   universe.
 - Images are a component of universes. Read-only images that serve as
   bases for several VMs.
 - VM references an Image as its base.
 - VMs run in -snapshot mode, so Close() is a pkill + nothing. Save is
   a stop+savevm+commit_all+quit. Destroy is Close() + rm -rf.
 - There's no multiple snapshots. The way you persistently branch the
   universe is cp -R.
